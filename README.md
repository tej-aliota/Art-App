# Art-App

This week I worked on creating a art program in tkinter. I like how it turned out and you can see in the pictures how I worked on making gradients. 
The tutorial was really well done and easy to follow. I like the app a lot and I think it is something to consider for the project. It could be combined with 
other programs I have done to create something really cool.
